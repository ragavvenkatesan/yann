If you are here for the first time you might want to consider doing the :ref:`quick_start` instead 
of doing the tutorials. The tutorials are meant for those who have initial practice or experience 
with the toolbox and its structure. If you'd just want to see the codes or run the examples for 
testing or other such purposes you could follow this tutorial/API. I recommend going through the 
tutorial just in case though.
